## Getting Started

This project reads in a CSV, and send it line by line over the resolume web API to edit a text block.
You will need to update the API URL for the layer/column of your text object and the port of your webserver

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies


## Dependency Management

This project currently has no dependencies

## Project Status

This project is in initial release being developed by @Jbuckle04.
The version on main *should* work, but if it doesn't I might fix it eventually
